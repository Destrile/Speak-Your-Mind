# SpeakYourMind

Speak Your Mind is a language learning Virtual Reality experience, built for Oculus Quest, using the VRTK. 

It was developed by Team Drago: Dexavier Chang, Jonah Dearth, Isaac Dunaevschi, Allyson Foley, Tim Sandburg, Sunny Mallard, Andrew Mair

The game is set in a Farmer's Market where the player is tasked to find the items they need written on the board, with the catch being that all of the items are written in Portuguese. When the player picks an item up, they will receive a translation and pronunciation of the item, leading them to incidentally learn new vocabulary by trying to find the items they need.

# Remaining Issues

Currently, there is only one level to complete. Once our programming is cleaned up, it will be much, much easier to rollout more content as well as more assets. Over 70 unique meshes with translations have been created!
